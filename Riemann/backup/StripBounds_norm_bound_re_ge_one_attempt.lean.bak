Backup note (non-code):

`Complex.Gamma.norm_bound_re_ge_one` in
`Riemann/Mathlib/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Gamma/StripBounds.lean` went through an
earlier overcomplicated proof attempt while refactoring strip/Stirling bounds.

That attempt was replaced by a cleaner proof (functional equation + product bound +
`Real.rpow` comparison). The previous intermediate state can be recovered from the git
history / Cursor patch log if needed.
