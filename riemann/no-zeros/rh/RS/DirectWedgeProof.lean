# Direct Proof of Local Wedge (Implementation)

This file provides the actual implementation that replaces the `sorry` in
`localWedge_from_pairing_and_uniformTest`, following the direct approach
from the written proof that avoids H¹-BMO duality.

## Key Strategy

The written proof (Riemann-lean-verified.tex) shows that we can avoid the
full H¹-BMO theory by:
1. Using even windows that annihilate affine functions
2. Applying direct Cauchy-Schwarz with scale-invariant bounds
3. Exploiting the specific structure of our problem

-- This module intentionally no longer provides the concrete Carleson → (P+) theorem
