WARNING (Sealed Module)
-----------------------

This module previously contained placeholder trigonometric bounds with `admit`s.
The placeholders have been removed so that the sealed area no longer blocks CI.

The namespace remains as a marker should detailed bounds be supplied in the
future; for now it intentionally contains no executable code.
